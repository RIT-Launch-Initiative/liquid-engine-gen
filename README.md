# liquid-engine-gen
This script is to be used to develop a small liquid bi-propellant rocket engine. It has been tested to be operational for the design of a 150 [lbf] liquid rocket engine using nitrous oxide and isopropanol as the propellants.

%% TODO List
% 1. Include selections of various efficiencies
%   - Nozzle efficiency is left to do
% 2. Ability to tune CEA output towards a specific combustion chamber temperature
% 3. Method of Characteristics Implementation (WIP)
% 4. Implement FOS script
%     - Outer wall thicknesses
% 5. Engine Volume/Weight from Variable thickness
